### API Integration
The dashboard integrates with these endpoints:
- **`/health`**: System health status
- **`/api/status`**: API feature availability
- **`/api/v1/engines`**: Test engine management
- **`/api/v1/observability/health`**: System metrics
- **`/api/v1/healing/statistics`**: Healing success rates
- **`/api/v1/tests/execute`**: Test execution endpoint
- **`/api/v1/tests/{id}/status`**: Real-time test status monitoring
- **`/api/v1/tests/{id}/result`**: Detailed test results with healing attempts
- **`/api/v1/tests/{id}/cancel`**: Test cancellation functionality
- **`/api/v1/results`**: Test execution history with pagination

### Build Process
```bash
# Development workflow
npm run build    # Compiles TypeScript and copies UI files to dist/
npm start        # Starts server serving from dist/ directory
```

**Important**: Always run `npm run build` after making changes to UI files, as the server serves from the `dist/` directory.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**CSS/JS Not Loading**:
1. Check browser console for MIME type errors
2. Verify files are served with correct Content-Type headers
3. Ensure HTML uses `/static/` prefix for CSS/JS paths
4. Run `npm run build` to update dist/ directory
5. Clear browser cache or use incognito mode

**Data Not Updating**:
1. Check network tab for API request failures
2. Verify backend services are running
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Ensure API endpoints are accessible

### Development Tips

- **File Changes**: Always rebuild after modifying UI files
- **Cache Issues**: Use incognito mode during development
- **Static Files**: Test with `curl -I http://localhost:3000/static/css/dashboard.css`
- **API Testing**: Verify endpoints with `curl http://localhost:3000/health`

## 🎯 Future Enhancements
