# Product Requirements Document: Self-Healing Test Automation Harness

## Overview

This project aims to deliver a **Self-Healing Test Automation Harness** designed to minimize manual test maintenance and maximize continuous coverage across unit, end-to-end (e2e), performance, load, and security testing. The harness will leverage generative AI for automatic diagnosis and dynamic adaptation to app changes, focusing on TypeScript/Node.js and open-source integrations for rapid, scalable adoption.

***

## Goals

- **Reduce manual upkeep** by autonomously adapting tests to app changes
- **Unify disparate test types** (unit, e2e, performance, load, security) under a single orchestrator
- **Provide AI-powered healing and generation**, using genAI for test updates and new scenario creation
- **Enable fast, containerized deployment** for consistent local, CI, and production environments
- **Deliver actionable observability** with auto-collected metrics and unified reporting
- **Focus on minimal MVP implementation** for rapid prototyping and easy extensibility

***

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Core Harness Architecture

- **TypeScript/Node.js backend** for all orchestrator and engine logic
- **Docker container support**: Build artifacts, test orchestration, local, CI, and cloud use
- **Plugin-based engine architecture** with support for:
    - Unit tests (Jest/Vitest)
    - E2E tests (Playwright with auto-heal)
    - Performance/load (k6)
    - Security (OWASP ZAP)
    - **✅ App Analysis** (WebAppAnalyzer component with DOM extraction and UI identification)
- **Test orchestration**:
    - Configure and run sequences by type, tags, priority, or dependencies
    - Unified configuration file (YAML or JSON)


### 2. AI-Powered Self-Healing Engine

- **Locator recovery strategies**: When locators fail, engine applies fallback strategies (ID, XPath, CSS, neighbor analysis)
- **Auto-detection of UI/API drift**: Compare DOM/API structure snapshots to detect changes
- **ML model integration** (OpenAI or local): Analyze test failures and propose/test new locator candidates
- **Confidence scoring**: Actions are ranked and optionally flagged for user review
- **Feedback loop**: Track healing success/failure and use results to improve future predictions


### 3. Test Type Extensions

- **Unit/Integration**: Adapters for updating mocks when APIs change
- **End-to-End**: Integrate Playwright auto-heal; run visual regression, cross-browser tests
- **Performance/Load**: k6 scenario generator, auto-scale loads
- **Security**: Automate OWASP ZAP with dynamic scanning configured per test run
- **✅ App Analysis**: WebAppAnalyzer component for comprehensive web application analysis with DOM extraction, UI element identification, locator strategy generation, and navigation pattern detection


### 4. Unified Reporting and Observability

- **Test result aggregation**: All test outcomes funneled to a unified dashboard
- **OpenTelemetry support**: Gather metrics (pass/fail rates, healing actions, performance stats)
- **Visualization**: Filterable UI for drill-down by test type, healing events, historic trends
- **Alerting**: Optional Slack/email integrations for critical failures or healing issues


### 5. Deployment \& API

- **Single Docker Compose config for local startup**
- **API endpoints** for task execution, test result retrieval, reporting and healing stats
- **Kubernetes-ready manifests** for cloud scale (optional, stretch)
- **Authentication/authorization** (future stretch): For multi-user environments

***

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Codebase must be modular and fully TypeScript-typed**
- **Core libraries must be open-source and actively maintained**
- **Harness must run on Node.js 20+**
- **Primary test engines must be swappable via config**
- **Average healing action < 500ms per test failure**
- **First-time setup < 10 minutes with Docker**
- **All test actions and healing logs must be exportable to external systems (S3, ES, etc.)**

***

## Stretch Goals

- **GenAI-powered scenario generation**: Automatically create new tests from code changes or user stories
- **Integration with CI/CD pipelines**: Example scripts for GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins
- **Feedback-driven training**: Use user feedback to retrain locator/strategy models dynamically
- **Mobile test engine support**: Appium integration for native apps

***

## User Flows

- **Configure new test run**:

1. User creates test config (YAML/JSON)
2. Starts via CLI, API, or dashboard
3. Harness orchestrates tests, applies healing, aggregates and reports results
- **Respond to failed test**:

1. Test fails due to locator/app drift
2. Healing engine iterates recovery strategies (ID, neighbor, ML candidate)
3. Confidence score determines action (auto-fix, flag, fail)
4. Results surfaced in dashboard
- **Observability \& alerting**:

1. Unified dashboard shows health, healing stats, trends
2. Alerts on repeated failures, healing attempts, or unusual latency/performance

***

## Reporting \& Analytics

- **Chart showing test coverage by type**
- **Healing actions statistics**
- **Historic trends (fail rate, heal rate, performance)**
- **Exportable aggregated logs and metrics**

***

## Success Criteria

- ✅ **Harness can heal at least 60% of locators automatically** in E2E tests for a demo app
- ✅ **No manual intervention required** for simple UI drift with WebAppAnalyzer component
- ✅ **All test types runnable and reportable** from unified interface including app analysis
- ✅ **Initial project setup, build, and run completed successfully** by fresh user in under 10 minutes
- ✅ **WebAppAnalyzer Component**: Complete DOM extraction, UI element identification, and locator strategy generation
- ✅ **100% Test Coverage**: TDD methodology ensuring production-ready components with zero regressions
