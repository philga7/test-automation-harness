## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript and copy UI files to dist/
- `npm start` - Start the production server
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm test` - Run all tests (unit + integration)
- `npm run test:unit` - Run unit tests only
- `npm run test:integration` - Run integration tests only
- `npm run test:e2e` - Run E2E tests with Playwright

### UI Development Workflow

When making changes to dashboard files:
1. **Edit files** in `src/ui/public/` directory
2. **Build project** with `npm run build` (copies to `dist/ui/public/`)
3. **Restart server** with `npm start` 
4. **Clear browser cache** or use incognito mode to see changes

**Note**: The server serves from `dist/` directory, so always rebuild after UI changes.
- `npm run test:e2e:ui` - Run E2E tests with Playwright UI
- `npm run test:e2e:report` - View HTML test reports
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `npm run artifacts:clean` - Clean all test artifacts
- `npm run artifacts:clean-screenshots` - Clean screenshot artifacts
- `npm run artifacts:clean-videos` - Clean video artifacts
- `npm run artifacts:clean-traces` - Clean trace artifacts

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `3000` | Server port |
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | Environment mode |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Logging level |
| `HEALING_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable self-healing |

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t test-automation-harness .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 test-automation-harness
```

## 📊 Architecture

The harness follows a plugin-based architecture with:

- **Core Orchestrator**: Manages test execution and coordination
- **Engine Plugins**: Swappable test engines for different test types
- **Healing Engine**: AI-powered test recovery and adaptation
- **AI Test Generation**: LLM-powered intelligent test scenario creation
- **Configuration System**: YAML-based test and environment configuration
- **Observability Layer**: Metrics collection and reporting

### 🔌 Plugin Architecture

The system is built on a robust plugin architecture that supports:

- **Dynamic Plugin Registration**: Plugins can be registered and discovered at runtime
- **Factory Pattern**: Test engines are created through a factory system
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean dependency management with a DI container
- **Interface-Based Design**: All plugins implement well-defined interfaces
- **Lifecycle Management**: Proper initialization and cleanup of plugin resources

#### ✅ Plugin Integration Success
- **AppAnalysisEngine Integration**: Complete integration with TestEngineFactory and PluginRegistry
- **Configuration Schema**: TypeScript-safe configuration with environment-specific overrides
- **YAML Configuration**: Full integration with default.yaml and environment configurations
- **Test Coverage**: 53 comprehensive tests with 100% success rate and zero regressions

#### Core Components

- **`ITestEngine`**: Interface for all test engines (Playwright, Jest, k6, OWASP ZAP)
- **`IHealingStrategy`**: Interface for self-healing algorithms
- **`PluginRegistry`**: Central registry for plugin management
- **`TestEngineFactory`**: Factory for creating and configuring test engines
- **`DependencyContainer`**: Simple dependency injection container

#### Demo the Architecture

```bash
# Run the plugin architecture demo
npx ts-node src/demo/run-demo.ts

# Run the Playwright E2E engine demo
npx ts-node src/demo/run-playwright-demo.ts
```

This demo shows:
- Plugin registration and discovery
- Test engine creation and execution
- Self-healing capabilities
- Complete lifecycle management

### Example Usage

```bash
# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

- **Traces**: Detailed execution traces for debugging
- **Reports**: HTML, JSON, and XML test reports

```bash
# Clean specific artifact types
npm run artifacts:clean-screenshots
npm run artifacts:clean-videos
npm run artifacts:clean-traces

# Clean all artifacts
npm run artifacts:clean
```
