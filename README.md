## 🐳 Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t test-automation-harness .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 test-automation-harness
```

## 📊 Architecture

The harness follows a plugin-based architecture with:

- **Core Orchestrator**: Manages test execution and coordination
- **Engine Plugins**: Swappable test engines for different test types
- **Healing Engine**: AI-powered test recovery and adaptation
- **Configuration System**: YAML-based test and environment configuration
- **Observability Layer**: Metrics collection and reporting

### 🔌 Plugin Architecture

The system is built on a robust plugin architecture that supports:

- **Dynamic Plugin Registration**: Plugins can be registered and discovered at runtime
- **Factory Pattern**: Test engines are created through a factory system
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean dependency management with a DI container
- **Interface-Based Design**: All plugins implement well-defined interfaces
- **Lifecycle Management**: Proper initialization and cleanup of plugin resources

#### Core Components

- **`ITestEngine`**: Interface for all test engines (Playwright, Jest, k6, OWASP ZAP)
- **`IHealingStrategy`**: Interface for self-healing algorithms
- **`PluginRegistry`**: Central registry for plugin management
- **`TestEngineFactory`**: Factory for creating and configuring test engines
- **`DependencyContainer`**: Simple dependency injection container

#### Demo the Architecture

```bash
# Run the plugin architecture demo
npx ts-node src/demo/run-demo.ts

# Run the Playwright E2E engine demo
npx ts-node src/demo/run-playwright-demo.ts
```

This demo shows:
- Plugin registration and discovery
- Test engine creation and execution
- Self-healing capabilities
- Complete lifecycle management

## 🎭 Playwright E2E Engine

The Playwright E2E Engine is fully implemented and provides comprehensive E2E testing capabilities:

### Features
- **Multi-Browser Support**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic recovery from element not found, timeout, and network errors
- **Artifact Collection**: Screenshots, videos, traces, and reports
- **Configuration Management**: Comprehensive Playwright configuration options
- **Health Monitoring**: Engine health status and metrics

### Example Usage

```bash
# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui

# View test reports
npm run test:e2e:report
```

### Test Examples

The `tests/e2e/` directory contains comprehensive examples:
- Navigation and interaction tests
- Form handling and validation
- Network request testing
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance measurement
- Mobile viewport testing
- Accessibility testing

### Artifact Management

All test artifacts are organized in the `artifacts/` directory:
- **Screenshots**: Visual verification of test execution
- **Videos**: Recordings of test sessions (on failure)
- **Traces**: Detailed execution traces for debugging
- **Reports**: HTML, JSON, and XML test reports

```bash
# Clean specific artifact types
npm run artifacts:clean-screenshots
npm run artifacts:clean-videos
npm run artifacts:clean-traces

# Clean all artifacts
npm run artifacts:clean
```
